# Gaussian-mixture-model-on-load_digits-
Applied GMM clustering on  load_digits dataset to group handwritten digit images based on pixel intensity patterns. The project demonstrates soft probabilistic cluster assignments, visualization of digit clusters, and handling of overlapping data, showcasing GMM's flexibility in modeling complex, non-linear distributions for unsupervised learning.
